##
## This file is aimed to attend the requests that come directly
## from the 'self' node. It is expected to attend the store requests that
## come from REST-store endpoint when those requests don't indicate
## any store-peer address.
##
## Notice that the REST-store requests normally assume that the REST
## server is acting as a store-client. In this module, we allow that
## such REST-store node can act as store-server as well by retrieving
## its own stored messages. The typical use case for that is when
## using `nwaku-compose`, which spawn a Waku node connected to a local
## database, and the user is interested in retrieving the messages
## stored by that local store node.

    else:
