## This is an extract from chronos/rate_limit.nim due to the found bug in the original implementation.
## Unfortunately that bug cannot be solved without harm the original features of TokenBucket class.
## So, this current shortcut is used to enable move ahead with nwaku rate limiter implementation.
## ref: https://github.com/status-im/nim-chronos/issues/500
##
## This version of TokenBucket is different from the original one in chronos/rate_limit.nim in many ways:
## - It has a new mode called `Compensating` which is the default mode.
##   Compensation is calculated as the not used bucket capacity in the last measured period(s) in average.
##   or up until maximum the allowed compansation treshold (Currently it is const 25%).
##   Also compensation takes care of the proper time period calculation to avoid non-usage periods that can lead to
##   overcompensation.
## - Strict mode is also available which will only replenish when time period is over but also will fill
##   the bucket to the max capacity.
