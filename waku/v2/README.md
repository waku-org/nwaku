# Waku v2

This folder contains code related to Waku v1, both as a node and as a protocol.

## Introduction

This is an implementation in Nim of Waku v2, which is currently in draft/beta stage.

See [spec](https://specs.vac.dev/specs/waku/v2/waku-v2.html).

## How to Build & Run

### Prerequisites

* GNU Make, Bash and the usual POSIX utilities. Git 2.9.4 or newer.
* PCRE

More information on the installation of these can be found [here](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus#prerequisites).

### Wakunode

```bash
# The first `make` invocation will update all Git submodules.
# You'll run `make update` after each `git pull`, in the future, to keep those submodules up to date.
make wakunode2

# See available command line options
./build/wakunode2 --help

# Connect the client directly with the Status test fleet
# TODO NYI
#./build/wakunode2 --log-level:debug --discovery:off --fleet:test --log-metrics
```

### Waku v2 Protocol Test Suite

```bash
# Run all the Waku v2 tests
make test2
```

You can also run a specific test (and alter compile options as you want):
```bash
# Get a shell with the right environment variables set
./env.sh bash
# Run a specific test
nim c -r ./tests/v2/test_waku_filter.nim
```

### Waku v2 Protocol Example

There is a more basic example, more limited in features and configuration than
the `wakunode1`, located in `examples/v2/basic2.nim`.

There is also a more full featured example in `examples/v2/chat2.nim`.

### Waku Quick Simulation

*NOTE: This section might be slightly out of date as it was written for Waku v1.*

One can set up several nodes, get them connected and then instruct them via the
JSON-RPC interface. This can be done via e.g. web3.js, nim-web3 (needs to be
updated) or simply curl your way out.

The JSON-RPC interface is currently the same as the one of Whisper. The only
difference is the addition of broadcasting the topics interest when a filter
with a certain set of topics is subcribed.

The quick simulation uses this approach, `start_network` launches a set of
`wakunode`s, and `quicksim` instructs the nodes through RPC calls.

Example of how to build and run:
```bash
# Build wakunode + quicksim with metrics enabled
make NIMFLAGS="-d:insecure" wakusim2

# Start the simulation nodes, this currently requires multitail to be installed
# TODO Partial support for Waku v2
./build/start_network2 --topology:FullMesh --amount:6 --test-node-peers:2
# In another shell run
./build/quicksim2
```

The `start_network2` tool will also provide a `prometheus.yml` with targets
set to all simulation nodes that are started. This way you can easily start
prometheus with this config, e.g.:

```bash
cd ./metrics/prometheus
prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
```

A Grafana dashboard containing the example dashboard for each simulation node
is also generated and can be imported in case you have Grafana running.
This dashboard can be found at `./metrics/waku-sim-all-nodes-grafana-dashboard.json`

To read more details about metrics, see [next](#using-metrics) section.

## Using Metrics

Metrics are available for valid envelopes and dropped envelopes.

To compile in an HTTP endpoint for accessing the metrics we need to provide the
`insecure` flag:
```bash
make NIMFLAGS="-d:insecure" wakunode2
./build/wakunode2 --metrics-server
```

Ensure your Prometheus config `prometheus.yml` contains the targets you care about, e.g.:

```
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "waku"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8008', 'localhost:8009', 'localhost:8010']
```

For visualisation, similar steps can be used as is written down for Nimbus
[here](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus#metric-visualisation).

There is a similar example dashboard that includes visualisation of the
envelopes available at `metrics/waku-grafana-dashboard.json`.

## Spec support

*This section last updated November 16, 2020*

All Waku v2 specs, except for bridge, are currently in draft.

## Docker Image

By default, the target will be a docker image with `wakunode`, which is the Waku v1 node.
You can change this to `wakunode2`, the Waku v2 node like this:

```bash
make docker-image MAKE_TARGET=wakunode2
docker run --rm -it statusteam/nim-waku:latest --help
```
