## How to Build & Run

These instructions are generic and apply to both Waku v1 and v2. For more
detailed instructions, see Waku v1 and v2 home above.

### Prerequisites

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

More information on the installation of these can be found [here](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus#prerequisites).

### Wakunode

```bash
# The first `make` invocation will update all Git submodules.
# You'll run `make update` after each `git pull`, in the future, to keep those submodules up to date.
make wakunode1 wakunode2

# See available command line options
./build/wakunode --help
./build/wakunode2 --help
