## nph - An opinionated Nim formatter
This prettifier tool is used to format the nwaku code base.

### VSCode Extension
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arnetheduck.vscode-nph

### GitHub
https://github.com/arnetheduck/nph

Make sure you use a binary from the following release:
https://github.com/arnetheduck/nph/releases/tag/v0.5.1

```bash
$ nph --version
v0.5.1-0-gde5cd48
```

### Installation and configuration
1. Ask the [nwaku team](https://discord.com/channels/1110799176264056863/1111541184490393691) about the required `nph` version.
2. Download the desired release from _GitHub_ and place the binary in the PATH env var.
3. Add the following content into `~/.config/Code/User/settings.json`:

```
{
    "[nim]": {
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "arnetheduck.vscode-nph"
    },
}
```

With that, every time a Nim file is saved, it will be formatted automatically.
