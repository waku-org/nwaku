title: Performance Benchmarks and Test Reports
---


## Introduction
This page summarises key performance metrics for nwaku and provides links to detailed test reports.

> ## TL;DR
>
> - Average Waku bandwidth usage: ~**10 KB/s** (minus discv5 Discovery) for 1KB message size and message injection rate of 1msg/s.  
Confirmed for topologies of up to 2000 Relay nodes.
> - Average time for a message to propagate to 100% of nodes: **0.4s** for topologies of up to 2000 Relay nodes.
> - Average per-node bandwidth usage of the discv5 protocol: **8 KB/s** for incoming traffic and **7.4 KB/s** for outgoing traffic,   
 in a network with 100 continuously online nodes.
> - Future improvements: A messaging API is currently in development to streamline interactions with the Waku protocol suite.  
Once completed, it will enable benchmarking at the messaging API level, allowing applications to more easily compare their  
own performance results.


## Insights

### Relay Bandwidth Usage: nwaku v0.34.0
The average per-node `libp2p` bandwidth usage in a 1000-node Relay network with 1KB messages at varying injection rates.


| Message Injection Rate | Average libp2p incoming bandwidth (KB/s) | Average libp2p outgoing bandwidth (KB/s) |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1 msg/s                | ~10.1                                    | ~10.3                                    |
| 1 msg/10s              | ~1.8                                     | ~1.9                                     |

### Message Propagation Latency: nwaku v0.34.0-rc1
The message propagation latency is measured as the total time for a message to reach all nodes.  
We compare the latency in different network configurations for the following simulation parameters:
- Total messages published: 600
- Message size: 1KB
- Message injection rate: 1msg/s

The different network configurations tested are:
- Relay Config: 1000 nodes with relay enabled
- Mixed Config: 210 nodes, consisting of bootstrap nodes, filter clients and servers, lightpush clients and servers, store nodes
- Non-persistent Relay Config: 500 persistent relay nodes, 10 store nodes and 100 non-persistent relay nodes

### Discv5 Bandwidth Usage: nwaku v0.34.0
The average bandwidth usage of discv5 for a network of 100 nodes and message injection rate of 0 or 1msg/s.  
The measurements are based on a stable network where all nodes have already connected to peers to form a healthy mesh.

|Message size         |Average discv5 incoming bandwidth (KB/s)|Average discv5 outgoing bandwidth (KB/s)|
|-------------------- |----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| no message injection| 7.88                                   | 6.70                                   |
