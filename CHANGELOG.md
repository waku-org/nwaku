## 2021-01-05 v0.2

This release contains the following changes:

- Calls to `publish` a message on `wakunode2` now `await` instead of `discard` dispatched [`WakuRelay`](https://github.com/vacp2p/specs/blob/master/specs/waku/v2/waku-relay.md) procedures.
- [`StrictNoSign`](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/pubsub#message-signing) enabled.
- Add JSON-RPC API for external access to `wakunode2` functionality:
  - Admin API retrieves information about peers registered on the `wakunode2`.
  - Debug API exposes debug information about a `wakunode2`.
  - Filter API saves bandwidth by allowing light nodes to filter for specific content.
  - Private API enables symmetric or asymmetric cryptography to encrypt/decrypt message payloads.
  - Relay API allows basic pub/sub functionality.
  - Store API retrieves historical messages.
- Add tutorial on how to use JSON-RPC API.
- Refactor: Move `waku_filter` protocol into its own module.

The Waku v2 implementation, and [most protocols it consist of](https://specs.vac.dev/specs/waku/),
are still in a draft/beta state. The Waku v1 implementation is stable but not under active development.
