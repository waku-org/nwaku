### Items to complete

All items below are to be completed by the owner of the given release.

- [ ] Create release branch with major and minor only ( e.g. release/v0.X ) if it doesn't exist.
- [ ] Assign release candidate tag to the release branch HEAD (e.g. `v0.X.0-beta-rc.0`, `v0.X.0-beta-rc.1`, ... `v0.X.0-beta-rc.N`).
- [ ] Generate and edit release notes in CHANGELOG.md.

- [ ] **Waku test and fleets validation**
  - [ ] Ensure all the unit tests (specifically js-waku tests) are green against the release candidate.
  - [ ] Deploy the release candidate to `waku.test` only through [deploy-waku-test job](https://ci.infra.status.im/job/nim-waku/job/deploy-waku-test/) and wait for it to finish (Jenkins access required; ask the infra team if you don't have it).
    - After completion, disable [deployment job](https://ci.infra.status.im/job/nim-waku/) so that its version is not updated on every merge to master.
    - Verify the deployed version at https://fleets.waku.org/.
    - Confirm the container image exists on [Harbor](https://harbor.status.im/harbor/projects/9/repositories/nwaku/artifacts-tab).
  - [ ] Analyze Kibana logs from the previous month (since the last release was deployed) for possible crashes or errors in `waku.test`.
      - Most relevant logs are `(fleet: "waku.test" AND message: "SIGSEGV")`.
  - [ ] Enable again the `waku.test` fleet to resume auto-deployment of the latest `master` commit.

- [ ] **Proceed with release**

  - [ ] Assign a final release tag (`v0.X.0-beta`) to the same commit that contains the validated release-candidate tag (e.g. `v0.X.0-beta-rc.N`) and submit a PR from the release branch to `master`.
  - [ ] Update [nwaku-compose](https://github.com/logos-messaging/nwaku-compose) and [waku-simulator](https://github.com/logos-messaging/waku-simulator) according to the new release.
  - [ ] Bump nwaku dependency in [waku-rust-bindings](https://github.com/logos-messaging/waku-rust-bindings) and make sure all examples and tests work.
  - [ ] Bump nwaku dependency in [waku-go-bindings](https://github.com/logos-messaging/waku-go-bindings) and make sure all tests work.
  - [ ] Create GitHub release (https://github.com/logos-messaging/nwaku/releases).
  - [ ] Submit a PR to merge the release branch back to `master`. Make sure you use the option "Merge pull request (Create a merge commit)" to perform the merge. Ping repo admin if this option is not available.

- [ ] **Promote release to fleets**
  - [ ] Ask the PM lead to announce the release.
  - [ ] Update infra config with any deprecated arguments or changed options.
  - [ ] Update waku.sandbox with [this deployment job](https://ci.infra.status.im/job/nim-waku/job/deploy-waku-sandbox/).
