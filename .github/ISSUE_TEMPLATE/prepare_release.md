    - [ ] Continuously stress `waku.test` fleet for a week (e.g. from `wakudev`)
    - [ ] Search _Kibana_ logs from the previous month (since last release was deployed), for possible crashes or errors in `waku.test` and `waku.sandbox`.
      - Most relevant logs are `(fleet: "waku.test" OR fleet: "waku.sandbox") AND message: "SIGSEGV"`

      - [ ] 1:1 Chats with each other

      - [ ] Close one instance, send messages with second instance, reopen first instance and confirm messages sent while offline are retrieved from store
    - [ ] Perform checks based _end user impact_
    - [ ] Ask other (Waku and Status) CCs to point their instance to `status.staging` for a week and use the app as usual.
    - [ ] Ask Status-QA to perform sanity checks (as described above) + checks based on _end user impact_; do specify the version being tested
    - [ ] Ask Status-QA or infra to run the automated Status e2e tests against `status.staging`
    - [ ] Get other CCs sign-off: they comment on this PR "used app for a week, no problem", or problem reported, resolved and new RC
    - [ ] **Get Status-QA sign-off**. Ensuring that `status.test` update will not disturb ongoing activities.
