          This PR may contain changes to **configuration options** of one of the apps.

          If you are introducing a breaking change (i.e. the set of options in latest release would no longer be applicable) make sure the original option is preserved with a *deprecation* note for 2 following releases before it is actually removed.

          Please also make sure the label `release-notes` is added to make sure any changes to the user interface are properly announced in changelog and release notes.
